# Example App

This directory contains an example application that demonstrates how to use the Bespoke Simulation template and its design system components. The example app showcases a simple interactive counter application that uses buttons, inputs, dropdowns, tags, and other design system components to illustrate the template's features and usage patterns. Accessible via the development server at `http://localhost:3000/example-app/index.html`.

**Important:** This example app is included for reference and testing purposes only. When customizing this template for your own application, you should remove this entire `example-app` directory and replace it with your own application code:

```bash
rm -rf client/example-app
```
